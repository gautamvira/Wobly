# Wobly
Wobly is a self-help mobile application that uses built-in smartphone hardware to make the user realize how impaired they may be so that they can decide what course of action to follow - whether or not to stop or slow their intoxicant intake - for themselves. Wobly makes the user take a test consisting of a few exercises that test the user’s cognitive and physical functions. The exercises are meant to check the user’s reaction time, immediate memory, and reading and tapping abilities. The application compares two tests - one taken when sober and the other when and if the user is impaired to visually represent how much worse was the user’s performance after being impaired for them to realize how visually impaired they might be. Furthermore, the application also has another type of test - The gait test - which works on determining if the user’s walking pattern, which includes speed and sway, is different from normal. This test requires the user to walk for five seconds during which the accelerometer and gyroscope data from the device is collected, processed, and used to calculate the degree of difference.
